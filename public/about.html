<p>Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area in California, I relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the fall of 2017. Since moving here I have pursued a career in healthcare, spending the last 3 years in blood donation services. I have played drums in bands for most of my life, and have a keen interest in photography. My current passion is pizza making. Ever since visiting Bolonga, Italy I have been haunted by the taste of the best pizza I have ever had. The dough was so light and airy, the sauce tasted like fresh tomatoes,and the toppings were sparse but just the right amount to not steal the show from the crust, which had a lingering smokyness from the wood fired oven. I have been chasing that ideal ever since.</p>
